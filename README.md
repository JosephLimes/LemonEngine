While this project was primarily created as a learning experience, it was still designed to be able to be used by others if so desired. As such, there is included documentation in the docs folder in the form of a web page.
Just find index.html and open it in a browser to view.
In addition to the engine itself, included is a demo showcasing some of its capabilities, as well as a level editor. To access either of these, simply select the appropriate loaded start level in LoadAllResources.cpp
